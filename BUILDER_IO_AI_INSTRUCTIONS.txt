How should the AI use your design system?

Our design system components are in src/components/core/

Custom components are in src/components/custom/

Component patterns and props:
- All components use Vue 3 Composition API with <script setup>
- All components are prefixed with "art-" (e.g., ArtStatsCard, ArtBarChart)
- All props are typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Components use SCSS scoped styles
- Components are organized by category: banners, base, cards, charts, forms, layouts, media, tables, text-effect, views

Element Plus 2.11.2 is used as the base UI framework. Available components include ElButton, ElInput, ElForm, ElTable, ElCard, ElDialog, ElSelect, etc.

Available component categories:
- Cards: src/components/core/cards/ (ArtStatsCard, ArtBarChartCard, ArtLineChartCard, ArtDonutChartCard, ArtProgressCard)
- Charts: src/components/core/charts/ (ArtBarChart, ArtLineChart, ArtRingChart, ArtMapChart, ArtRadarChart)
- Forms: src/components/core/forms/ (ArtForm, ArtSearchBar, ArtWangEditor)
- Layouts: src/components/core/layouts/ (ArtHeaderBar, ArtSidebarMenu, ArtBreadcrumb, ArtPageContent)

Types are defined in src/types/component/

Composables are in src/composables/ (useChart, useTable, useAuth, useTheme)

You can refer to files in your repository directly:
- src/components/core/cards/art-stats-card/index.vue
- src/components/core/charts/art-bar-chart/index.vue
- src/components/core/forms/art-form/index.vue
- src/types/component/chart.ts

Always use full import paths with @/ alias:
import ArtStatsCard from '@/components/core/cards/art-stats-card/index.vue'

Use TypeScript for all props and data types. Follow the art-* naming convention for components.
